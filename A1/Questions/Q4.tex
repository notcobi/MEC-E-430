The $u$ velocity component of a steady, two-dimensional, incompressible flow field is $u = 3ax^2 - 2bxy$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants. The velocity component $v$ is unknown. Generate an expression for $v$ as a function of $x$ and $y$.

\subsection*{Solution}
The continuity equation for incompressible flow is given by
\begin{align*}
    \nabla \cdot \vec{v} &= 0 \\
    \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} &= 0
\end{align*}
Substituting the given expression for $u$ into the continuity equation, we have
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(3ax^2 - 2bxy) + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} &= 0 \\
    6ax - 2by + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} &= 0 
\end{align*}
Solving for $v$, we have
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} &= 2by - 6ax \\
    \Aboxed{v &= by^2 - 6axy + g(x)}
\end{align*}
